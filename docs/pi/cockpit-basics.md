# Cockpit Basics
The Cockpit web console is a web-based graphical interface
By using it, you can perform system administration tasks,
such as inspecting and controlling services, managing storage,
configuring networks, analyzing network issues, and inspecting logs. 
Of course, it's also very handy for administering Asterisk on
your AllStarLink Pi Appliance!

# What is the Cockpit Console
What is the Cockpit Console

The Cockpit Console is a web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your
AllStarLink Pi Appliance.

The Cockpit Console enables you to perform a wide range of administration tasks, including:

    Managing AllStarLink, Asterisk, and its related applications
    Managing services
    Managing user accounts
    Managing and monitoring system services
    Configuring network interfaces
    Reviewing system logs
    Updating software
    

The Cockpit Console uses the same system concepts as you would use in a
terminal, and actions performed in a terminal are immediately reflected
in the Cockpit Console. That is to say, you can use Cockpit and
an SSH connection interchangeably at your desire.

You can monitor the logs of application. In addition, you can change the
settings directly in the web console or through the terminal. 

Throughout this documentation a host named `node460181.local` is used as
the example host. Substitute that name with your own node's name as it 
was set during the imaging process.

remember the access level across logins, to access certain functions
you may need to enable Administrative access from Limited access.
Do do that:

access.
