## Welcome to ASL3

AllStarLink’s app_rpt version 3 is the next generation of repeater and hotspot software.  This version of app_rpt has been redesigned to run on the latest operating systems, current LTS version of Asterisk®, and modern hardware. In other words, ASL3 will currently run on Debian 12, Asterisk 20, Raspberry Pi's, amd64, x86, virtual hosts.

The update from Asterisk version 1.4 to 20 implements over 15 years of bug fixes, security improvements and enhancements to the core asterisk application.  This update required app_rpt to be heavily modified to run on the latest version of Asterisk®.  It brings with it the latest Asterisk® applications, channel drivers and other functionality.

As part of this update, app_rpt has been refactored to make the code base easier to maintain and enhance.  This process has been going on for over two years and will continue.  The app\_rpt code base will meet all current Asterisk® coding guidelines.
