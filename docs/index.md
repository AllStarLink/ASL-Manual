# AllStarLink Manuals

AllStarLink’s app\_rpt version 3 (ASL3) is the next generation of repeater and hotspot software.  This version of app\_rpt has been redesigned to run on the latest operating systems and the current LTS version of Asterisk® 20. ASL3 runs on Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5 as well as amd64 and x86.

The update from Asterisk version 1.4 to 20 implements over 15 years of bug fixes, security improvements and enhancements to the core asterisk application.  This update required app\_rpt to be heavily modified to run on the latest version of Asterisk®.  It brings with it the latest Asterisk® applications, channel drivers and other functionality.

As part of this update, app\_rpt has been refactored to make the code base easier to maintain and enhance.  This process has been going on for over a year and will continue.  The app\_rpt code base will meet all current Asterisk® coding guidelines.
