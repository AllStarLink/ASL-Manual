# ASL3 New Commands

What do we want here?
New and different ASL3 commands go here. No OS commands.

Do we want things like :

```bash
asterisk -rx "rpt localnodes"
```

or :

```bash
astup.sh
astdn.sh
astres.sh
```

or do we want to include some Linux commands like :

```bash
hostnamectl
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ASL-WA3WCO
```

```bash
timedatectl
timedatectl list-timezones
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
```

```bash
networkctl status
```

```bash
systemctl status dahdi
systemctl status asterisk
systemctl status asl3-update-nodelist
apachectl status
```

Are there any web links we should include ?
Only a mention: Other ASL commands and settings are on documented on wiki.allstarlink.org
