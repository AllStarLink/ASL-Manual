# ASL3 User Guide

This is the AllStarLink version 3 User's Guide. No doubt you're you've noticed this is not a Wiki. The [ASL Wiki](https://wiki.allstarlink.org) still exists while this manual covers ASL3 specifics.

Did you see the "Next" and "Previous" menu items? Those will page to the next section of this document in the order of the bullets below. We think you'll find this an orderly way to learn about ASL3.  Lets get started.
